= Generator Scripts

== Purpose

Helper scripts in this directory are invoked by the layer manager when a layer declares `X-Env-Layer-Type: dynamic`. Each generator reads a template layer file (`$1`) and writes the rendered result to the output file path (`$2`). This is a reference for each script. The layer manager guarantees that the input file and parent directory of the output file are valid.

== Available Generators
