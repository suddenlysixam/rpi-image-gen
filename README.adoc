= rpi-image-gen

rpi-image-gen is a tool for creating custom software images for Raspberry Pi devices. It runs best on a Raspberry Pi Host running up-to-date 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS.

**For the tool used to create the Raspberry Pi OS distribution, please go to https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen**

**NOTE** rpi-image-gen is under active development. Please report issues at https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-image-gen. Feature suggestions are welcome.

== Quick Start

=== From Source
----
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-image-gen.git
cd rpi-image-gen
sudo ./install_deps.sh
./rpi-image-gen build -c ./config/bookworm-minbase.cfg
----

The device image will be in `./work/image-deb12-arm64-min/deb12-arm64-min.img`

Install it onto an SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Select "Use Custom" if using the GUI, or use the command line:

----
sudo rpi-imager --cli ./work/image-deb12-arm64-min/deb12-arm64-min.img /dev/mmcblk0
----

**Note:** This image intentionally has login passwords disabled.

To install via other means, for example using https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[rpiboot,window=_blank] with https://github.com/raspberrypi/pi-gen-micro[pi-gen-micro,window=_blank]'s usb mass-storage or fastboot gadget, or provisioning with https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-sb-provisioner[rpi-sb-provisioner,window=_blank], take a look at the documentation in those repositories.

The rpi-image-gen link:./docs/index.adoc[technical documentation] and link:./examples[examples directory] provide customisation and usage guidance.

== Why use this?

* **Fast builds** - Uses pre-built packages instead of building from source
* **Production-ready** - Same binaries used by millions in production worldwide
* **Compatible** - Use the same library versions as Raspberry Pi OS
* **Customisable** - Configure your filesystem exactly as needed
* **Secure** - Integrate with *rpi-sb-provisioner* (https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-sb-provisioner) to automatically set up signed boot and encrypted filesystems
* **Auditable** - Generate Software Bill of Materials and CVE reports to give consumers of your image confidence

rpi-image-gen is a versatile image generation and build automation tool designed to create reproducible operating system artefacts. It supports producing bootable disk images, partitioned media layouts, and device-agnostic filesystem tarballs from declarative configurations. The tool integrates package management, filesystem assembly, and image layout definition, enabling consistent builds for embedded devices, virtual machines, and general-purpose systems. By separating build logic from target hardware specifics, it simplifies cross-platform image creation, CI workflows, and distribution packaging.

== Core Concepts

* **Configuration** - Declare variables and build attributes in simple, easy to read files
* **Layers** - Modular, composable components with automatic variable checking, validation policies and comprehensive documentation
* **Hooks** - Shell scripts that run at defined points in the build process

== Architecture

rpi-image-gen uses:

* **bdebstrap** (https://github.com/bdrung/bdebstrap) for modular layer application
* **mmdebstrap** (https://gitlab.mister-muffin.de/josch/mmdebstrap) for filesystem construction
* **genimage** (https://github.com/pengutronix/genimage/) for disk image creation
* **YAML** for file-based configuration
* **podman unshare** to handle filesystem ownership correctly using linux namespaces

The tool runs as a regular user and does not require root privileges.

== Dependencies

Install required base dependencies:
----
sudo ./install_deps.sh
----

See the `depends` file for the complete list of required packages.

=== Important

rpi-image-gen has been developed on Raspberry Pi OS which, at the time of writing, is Debian Bookworm arm64. It heavily favours Debian-based systems and will run on non-arm64 platforms (such as x86_64) via QEMU emulation or inside container environments. However, there is currently no formal support for these non-native environments.

If utilising sparse images in your workflow, e.g. with *rpi-sb-provisioner* (https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-sb-provisioner), please refer to the link:docs/provisioning/index.adoc[provisioning documentation] for important advice.

== Basic Usage

----
# Building
rpi-image-gen build -c config/my-system.yaml

# Specify the source directory
rpi-image-gen build -S /path/to/my/assets -c /path/to/my/config.yaml

# List all available layers
rpi-image-gen layer --list

# Describe a layer
rpi-image-gen layer --describe my-layer

# Lint a layer file when developing a custom solution
rpi-image-gen metadata --lint /path/to/my/layer.yaml

# See all options
rpi-image-gen --help
----

== Integration

rpi-image-gen is designed for integration with external build systems:

- **External directories** can provide custom configs and layers
- **Reusable components** allow developers to easily apply their customisations on top of built-in defaults
- **Hooks** provide integration points throughout the build process
- **SBOM generation** for security and compliance workflows
