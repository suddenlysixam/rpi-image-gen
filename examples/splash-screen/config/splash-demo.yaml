# Splash Screen Demo Configuration
#
# This example demonstrates adding a custom boot splash screen to Raspberry Pi OS.
#
# To build this image:
#   ./rpi-image-gen build -c examples/splash-screen/config/splash-demo.yaml
#
# The image will be created at:
#   work/image-deb13-arm64-splash/deb13-arm64-splash.img
#
# Before building, create your splash screen (24-bit TGA, max 1920x1080, <224 colours):
#   ./layer/rpi/splash-screen/EXAMPLE-splash.sh "Your Text" splash.tga
#
# Then update the image_path below to point to your splash screen.
